# PixelArk

**PixelArk** is a desktop app to manage and view media â€” both local and online â€” in one place.  
Youâ€™ll be able to browse images, videos, and other media directly from the internet as smoothly as if they were stored locally.

The app will also let you organize media using tags and provide a clean interface to keep everything easy to access.
